# Featured Page Widget for Genesis Sites with Static Home Page

This plugin works within the Genesis Framework. It replaces the default Genesis Featured Page widget.

## Description

This plugin is a very slightly modified version of the Genesis Featured Page Widget. For sites using a static front page plus a posts page, this plugin will allow you to display your posts page in the widget. Due to how WordPress handles this page, if you enable the widget to show content, it will actually show content from the first post on the page, not the page's content. At this time, I do not know how to get around that.


## Requirements
* WordPress 3.8, tested up to 4.0
* the Genesis Framework
